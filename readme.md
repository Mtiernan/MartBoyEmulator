 A incomplete gameboy emulator that I started several years ago. Every now and again, I break it out to work on it. The ultimate goal is to be able to run tetris.
 
 Currently mainly working on inplementing cpu, bad jumpe call is fixed on to implementing more opcodes.
 
 The project does make use of the SDL 2 library.
