 A incomplete gameboy emulator that I started several years ago. Every now and again, I break it out to work on it. The ultimate goal is to be able to run tetris.
 
 Currently mainly working on inplementing cpu, but encountered a bad logic bug that is causing bad jumps
 
 The project does make use of the SDL 2 library.
